### Tasks Completed

    [x] Task 5 – Collections : Learned and practiced Dart collections including Lists, Sets, and Maps with hands-on coding exercises. Covered list creation, manipulation, iteration, sorting, filtering, and transformation using built-in Dart methods.

    [x] Lists : Practiced list creation using literals and constructors, accessing elements using indexing, adding and removing elements, iterating using for, forEach, and for-in loops, using list properties, applying higher-order functions like map, where, any, and every, sorting lists, reversing lists, and using the spread operator.

    [x] Sets : Learned about set creation, uniqueness of elements, adding and removing elements, performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference, converting between lists and sets, and iterating through sets.

    [x] Maps : Practiced map creation, understanding key-value pairs, accessing values using keys, adding, updating, and removing entries, checking for keys and values, using map properties and methods, and iterating through keys, values, and entries.

    [x] Task 6 – List Manipulation (Advanced) : Practiced advanced list manipulation techniques including higher-order functions, list slicing, searching, joining, flattening nested lists, list generators, and conversion between different collection types.

    [x] Higher-Order Functions : Practiced map(), where(), reduce(), fold(), forEach(), any(), and every() for filtering, transformation, aggregation, and logical checks on collections.

    [x] Advanced List Operations : Practiced sublist(), indexOf(), lastIndexOf(), join(), expand(), take(), takeWhile(), skip(), skipWhile(), toList(), and toSet().

    [x] Task 11 – Error Handling : Learned and implemented Dart exception handling using try-catch blocks, multiple catch clauses, on keyword for handling specific exceptions, finally blocks, throwing exceptions, creating custom exceptions, and using stack traces for debugging.

    [x] Project 3 – Dart Collections & Error Handling Mini Project : Built a mini console-based Dart project implementing Lists, Sets, Maps, advanced list manipulation, and structured error handling to simulate real-world programming scenarios.

### Technical "Today I Learned" (TIL)

    - Learned how to efficiently work with Dart collections including Lists, Sets, and Maps for structured data storage and manipulation.

    - Practiced list operations such as adding, removing, sorting, filtering, transforming, and iterating through elements using multiple looping techniques.

    - Gained strong understanding of higher-order functions like map(), where(), reduce(), and fold() to perform data transformation and aggregation.

    - Learned advanced list manipulation techniques including slicing, flattening nested lists, joining lists into strings, and generating lists dynamically.

    - Understood how Sets maintain uniqueness and how to perform mathematical set operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

    - Learned how to design and manage key-value based data structures using Maps for real-world use cases.

    - Gained hands-on experience with structured exception handling using try-catch blocks, specific exception handling using on, and safe cleanup using finally blocks.

    - Learned how to throw custom exceptions and use stack traces to debug runtime errors effectively.

    - Implemented clean coding practices by combining data structures and error handling to build a structured mini project.

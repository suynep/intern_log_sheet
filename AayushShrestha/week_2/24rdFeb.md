    [x] Dart's History and Use Cases : Learned about Dart’s history, its evolution since 2011, and its primary use cases including Flutter-based cross-platform development, web, desktop, embedded systems, backend APIs using Shelf / Dart Frog, and CLI tools.
    
    [x] Dart's Basics : Practiced Dart program structure including the main() function, console input and output using stdin, stdout and print(), different types of comments (single-line, multi-line, documentation), and basic syntax rules.
    
    [x] Dart variables and constants : Learned and practiced variable declaration using var, dynamic, explicit types, final, const, late, nullable and non-nullable variables, and understood their usage for safe and optimized programming.

### Technical "Today I Learned" (TIL)

    - Learned how to install, configure, and verify Dart SDK setup for development.

    - Understood Dart’s history, purpose, and its strong adoption through Flutter for cross-platform application development.

    - Practiced Dart basics including the use of main() as the entry point, input handling using stdin.readLineSync(), output using stdout.write() and print(), and the use of documentation comments for structured code documentation.

    - Learned about inferred typing and explicit typing, including the correct usage of var, dynamic, final, const, and late variables.

    - Practiced nullable and non-nullable concepts along with null safety operators to prevent runtime null errors.

    - Gained understanding of variable scopes including global, local, and instance scope based on code block structure.

    - Learned key best practices such as using static const for class-level constants and understanding immutability differences between final and const.

# Daily Intern Log: 16th Feb. 2026

### **Intern: Suyash Nepal**

## Focus: Learning
### Tasks Completed

- [x] **Day 01 Readings**: Read about the Linux terminal, Terminal vs. GUI applications, common navigation commands like `ls`, `cd` etc. and file operation commands like `cat`, `touch`, `mv` etc.
- [x] **Day 01 Practice Task**: Implement the practice question regarding creating a folder `intern_week1`, creating files within, using `vim`, and viewing the output using the `cat` command.

### Technical "Today I Learned" (TIL)

- About the terminal, and the linux environment as a whole, extensively utilizing LLMs, StackOverflow, and related sources.
- Concept/Tool: Terminal Vs. GUI, Navigation/File Operation Commands
- Key Takeaway: Terminal Commands make it super efficient for performing day-to-day dev tasks such as creating files, navigating directories, and editing files on the go using tools like `vim` and `neovim`.
- Code:

```bash
cd ~ # navigate to home folder
mkdir intern_week1 # for the time being, create at home folder for practice
cd intern_week1
touch day1.txt notes.txt
vim day1.txt # add contents to day1.txt file
vim notes.txt # add contents to notes.txt file
cat day1.txt # view content of day1.txt
cat notes.txt # view content of notes.txt
```

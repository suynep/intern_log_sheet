# Daily Intern Log: 23rd Feb. 2026

### **Intern: Suyash Nepal**

## Focus: Learning (Dart Installation, Syntax, Variables, Types, AOT+JIT architecture, DartVM, `.dill` IR)
### Tasks Completed

- [x] **Day 01 Readings**: [Overview of Dart](https://dart.dev/overview#platform), [History of Dart](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)#History>), [Flutter Garbage Collector](https://blog.flutter.dev/flutter-dont-fear-the-garbage-collector-d69b3ff1ca30?gi=5ce461097d5a), [Built-in Types](https://dart.dev/language/built-in-types#numbers), [Runes](https://api.dart.dev/dart-core/Runes-class.html), [parse and tryParse](https://api.dart.dev/search.html?q=parse), String Methods, Interpolation, Operations, [final, late, const, dynamic, var](https://dart.dev/language/variables)
- [x] **Day 01 Practice Task**: Completed!

### Technical "Today I Learned" (TIL)

- Dart is a strongly, statically typed language with a generational garbage collector, especially built for building client-facing applications with seamless cross-platform support
- Dart has a vast standard library, and supports a diverse range of operations
- Differences between `final` and `const` types (mostly time and way of initialization: run-time vs. compile-time)
- Workings of `late` using the Dart Debugger, and `dart:developer` `debugger()`
- Nullable and non-nullable types
- Comments (single, multiline, documentation comments)
- `main()` entry point
- Data types and associated operations
- `parse`, `tryParse` methods for String -> number conversion, and also realized that this same naming is followed for many String -> Object type conversion in dart
- `String`, `bool`, `rune` and `symbol`
- String Interpolation
- String Methods (`contains`, `trim`, `trimLeft`, `trimRight`, `endsWith`, `indexOf`)
- `toString()` method
- Learn to use the basics of The Dart Devtools Suite (esp. **Debugger**)


### Work Evidence

### Blockers and Challenges

- The [Documentation](https://dart.dev/language) and the [API Reference](https://api.dart.dev/) contained some terminologies that were difficult to grasp, and when I felt I was diving too deep, I refrained from going further to respect the constraints of time. However, it was fun, overall. 
> *How deep is too deep, though? What is depth if not the facade of limitations erected by the human mind...*
- None today! :)

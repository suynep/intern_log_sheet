### Work Evidence

> **Disclaimer**: These are carefully curated, handcrafted notes with no use of AI in writing. AI (Claude) was used in my personal workflow to clarify certain concepts and fact checks but not for writing the notes.

> Link for associated notes I grabbed from the [official docs](https://dart.dev/language/) and the [API reference](https://api.dart.dev/) are in the *TIL* section


- Also solved Problem 1 and Problem 2 out of the 4 assigned ones. The code, for the time being, can be found at: <https://github.com/suynep/dart_essentials/blob/main/problems/>



### Blockers and Challenges

- The [Documentation](https://dart.dev/language) and the [API Reference](https://api.dart.dev/) contained some terminologies that were difficult to grasp, and when I felt I was diving too deep, I refrained from going further to respect the constraints of time. However, it was fun, overall.

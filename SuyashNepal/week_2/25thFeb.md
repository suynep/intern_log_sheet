# Daily Intern Log: 25th Feb. 2026

### **Intern: Suyash Nepal**

## Focus: Practice Problems, Error Handling, Factory Pattern, Extra Practice Problems, Loops 
### Tasks Completed

- [x] **Day 03 Readings**: [Loops in Dart](https://dart.dev/language/loops), [Error Handling in Dart](https://dart.dev/language/error-handling), [Branches](https://dart.dev/language/branches) 
- [x] **Day 03 Practice Task**: Completed!

### Technical "Today I Learned" (TIL)

- Effective loop selection (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, `for-in`) directly impacts readability and control flow clarity, especially when handling collections versus condition-driven iterations.
- Structured error handling in Dart using `try`, `catch`, `on`, and `finally` improves program resilience and enables more granular exception control.
- Conditional branching (`if`, `else if`, `switch`) becomes significantly more powerful when combined with clean guard clauses to reduce nesting and improve maintainability.
- Applying the Factory Pattern encourages decoupled object creation, making codebases more extensible and easier to scale without modifying core logic.


### Work Evidence

- Solved Problem 1, 2, 3, 4. The code, for the time being, can be found at: <https://github.com/suynep/dart_essentials/blob/main/problems/>

### Blockers and Challenges

- The [Documentation](https://dart.dev/language) and the [API Reference](https://api.dart.dev/) contained some terminologies that were difficult to grasp, and when I felt I was diving too deep, I refrained from going further to respect the constraints of time. However, it was fun, overall.

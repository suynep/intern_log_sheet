### Technical "Today I Learned" (TIL)

- Concept/Tool: Process & Package Management
- Key Takeaway: I learned what is process and specially what foregroung and background process really are. I learned how to monitor the performance of the system using htop.

- Code:

1. ps: to see the process status
2. top: to see the current process running in the system
3. htop: to monitor the performance of the system
4. kill: to kill the process using the PID
5. kill -9: to kill the process using the signal
6. sudo: to give the administrative permissions to execute commands which requires high security
7. brew install: to install the brew package which helps us to install all the software package
8. brew uninstall: to uninstall the brew package
9. brew search: to search specific package using the package name
10. brew list: to list the packages
11. brew update: to update the brew newest version

## Focus: Git Fundamentals
### Tasks Completed

- Initialized the git repository and made 5 meaningful commits. - Created a branch name feature/test and made changes into that branch like adding a new file and content. And later on merged that into main branch.

### Technical "Today I Learned" (TIL)

- Concept/Tool: Git Fundamentals
- Key Takeaway: I learned about git basics including branching and merging.

Code:
- `git init`- to initialize a directory
- `git status` - to check the current status of the current working tree.
- `git add` - to add files in staging area.
- `git commit` - to send files from staging area to our repository.
- `git log` - to check the information about our repository like unique id and author name.
- `git diff`- to check the difference between our previous and current commits.
- `git branch`- to check the current branch name.
- `git checkout`- to add new branch or switchung between branches.
- `git merge`- to merge two files in the same repository.

### Tasks Completed

### Technical "Today I Learned" (TIL)

- Concept/Tool: File System and Permissions
- Key Takeaway: I learned that creating folders and all the commands of file system are very interesting and convinient to use. However learning to change permission was quite challenging for me.
- Code:

- `mkdir` - to create single folder and nested folder.
- `rm` - to remove a single file.
- `rm -r` - to remove a directory.
- `cp` - to copy file and folder from source to destination
- `mv`- to rename or move the file from src to destination.
- `touch`- to create a file.
- `chmod`- to change the file permission using r, w and x.
- `chown`- to change the owner of the directory.

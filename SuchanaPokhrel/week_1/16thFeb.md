\* Installed required tools (Git, Curl, Vim).

\* Accessed and explored the terminal interface.

\* Practiced basic navigation commands.

\* Created folders and text files for practice.

\### Technical "Today I Learned" (TIL)



\- Concept/Tool: Terminal vs GUI, Basic Command Structure. 

\- Key Takeaway: I gained the difference between terminal vs GUI. Terminal is much interactive and efficient compared to GUI because it allows direct interaction with OS using commands. Most terminal commands include ls,ls -la, pwd, cd, man etc.

\- Code: 

\* pwd: Display current directory path

\* ls: List directory contents

\* ls -la: List all files including hidden files

\* cd: Change directory

\* clear: Clear terminal screen

\* history: Show previously executed commands

\* man: Access manual pages for commands

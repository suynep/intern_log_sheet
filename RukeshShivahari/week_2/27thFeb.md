### **Intern: Rukesh Shivahari**

### Week 2 Day 05: [Project 4 Shopping Cart].

### Tasks Completed

    [] Shopping Cart : A simple CRUD application that has two different modules, admin and customer where admin can create, read, update and delete the item while customer can easily read items, add items in the cart and buy the items added to the cart. These operations work as expected, but the exceptions and errors have not yet been handled. Furthermore, there are various edge cases to be considered for making the app free bug code. 

### Technical "Today I Learned" (TIL)

    - I learned to implement new way to format the output using padLeft(), padRight() which are builtin methods in String class that adds white spaces (if not specified) or padding characters to a string until it reaches a specific width. It really helped to display the given contents in the desired format easily unlike the use of special common escape sequences like '\n', '\t';



### Blockers and Challenges
- None

### 💬 Mentor Feedback
- Handle Exceptions and errors
- Handle all possible edge cases 
- Proper comment for better description of the code 
- Refactor the current code into class based format

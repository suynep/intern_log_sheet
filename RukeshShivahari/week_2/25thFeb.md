### **Intern: Rukesh Shivahari**

### Week 2 Day 03: [List Manipulation(Advanced), Control Flow & Functions].

### Tasks Completed

    [] Dart List Manipulation : Got to know about advanced list manipulation in Dart through different list's higher order functions like map, where, reduce, fold etc and operations like sublist, indexOf, join, expand etc. Researched on what number and types of arguments these methods take and what they return. 
    Additionally, had insight on the list generators like List.generate, List.filled and this unique idea of list comprehension.
   
    [] Control Flow : Researched on the proper control flow in Dart programming language and how it runs. Acquired knowledge on different control flow concepts like Conditional Statements and Loops which are the most common ways of controlling the flow of the program in Dart. Got to know about this handy concept called pattern matching while experimenting with the conditional statements.

    [] Functions : As Dart is an object oriented programming language where even functions are objects and has a type, it is core fundamental of Dart. Researched on functions and how they are declared, assigned, called and executed. Had walkthrough on the basics of function in dart and its advanced concepts too like anonymous functions/lambda, first class functions, arrow functions, higher order functions , recursive functions and the most intriguing thing called closures in function.

  
    [] Practice Task : Completed and practiced the required tasks related to the Dart list manipulations, control flow like conditional statements and loops, functions.

### Technical "Today I Learned" (TIL)

    - As basic list concept was already learned, during this task I learned about advanced  list concept like map, where, expand, takeWhile etch which are lazily initialized like the function doesn't execute immediately and it only runs when the result is actually needed. I even learned this unique idea in dart called list comprehension  which is used to create or transform lists in a clean, readable, declarative way amd instead of writing loops manually, it generates lists directly inside [].

    - I learned about what really is control flow like conditional statements and loops in dart. I learned a new way that the if-case statement provides a way to match and destructure against a single pattern and to test a value against multiple patterns switch is used. I even got to know invaluable differences between switch expression and switch statement. So I got to know about this new concept of pattern matching in  switch. While in loops I experimented using for, for-in, while and do while. I even got to know about break which stops the iteration of loop right just in middle and the continue keyword just skips to next iteration ignoring the rest of the logic inside the loop.

    - When talking about functions in dart I learned the ways to declare a function as normally and as a variable too. I even got to know about function as first class objects where the function can be used as the arguments and as a return type and assigned to a variable too. This unique concept of closures in dart helped me to understand about lexical scope and lexical closures. Furthermore, I even learned that how a function can call itself again and again with the concept of recursive function. Anyways as anonymous functions(lambda) and arrow function are used frequently in the Dart I got look into it with doing some experimentation with it.

    - Practiced and experimented with different data types , operators and collections in dart and learned more about its related methods and shorthands.

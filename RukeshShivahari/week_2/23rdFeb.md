# Daily Intern Log: [2026/02/23]

### **Intern: Rukesh Shivahari**

### Week 2 Day 01: [Dart Basics & Setup, Variables & Constants].

### Tasks Completed
    [] Dart Setup : Installed Dart SDK and setup the development environment
   
    [] Dart's History and Use Cases : Got to know what was Dart invented for, it was unveiled in 2011 originally designed as a replacement for JS in browsers. But the future had its own plans and later on Dart was known popularly for the cross platform app development that was due to rise of Flutter, one of the dart's framework. This programming language is used for many things in the software development field like Mobile, Web, Desktop and Embedded systems. It is used in server through its framework like Shelf or Dart Frog for APIs, CLI tools and other backend services.
    
    [] Dart's Basics : Common basics and functionalities of Dart like the use of 'main()' function and simple input and output functions like  stdin, stdout, print. Dart's special characters for comments (single line and multi line) which becomes a helping hand to the developers. With it got to know about documentation lines in Dart.

    [] Dart variables and constants : A simple but important feature for every programming language which later on becomes a building block for creating gigantic programs and software applications. So, these concepts in Dart is very much important and has its own rules and features on implementing these variables and constants safely and optimally.

    [] Practice Task : Completed the required tasks related to the Dart constants and variables as provided. 


### Technical "Today I Learned" (TIL)

    - I learned about installing and setting up the Dart SDK and got to know about Dart's history and its core use cases.

    - Learnt dart basics like use of main() function as it is the main entry point to run the Dart programs and it even takes List<String> as arguments so that when executing through cli we can pass optional arguments if needed. Furthermore, learnt about the simple input functions like stdin.readLineSync() that waits for the user's feedback/input in the CLI while stdout.write() and print() functions are used for displaying contents. Got clear understanding of some technical phrases or concepts like top level function and variable, lazy initialization, string interpolation, "late" variable modifier

    - While walking through this basic dart got to know about the documentations in the dart like the format used for the proper documentation of each module in the program and learnt the dart cli command 'dart doc' to generate documentation for the given dart package/project.

    - Learnt about different types of variables like inferred typing and explicit typing where 'var', 'const', 'dynamic', 'final' are the inferred typing data type that infers the variable type based on the value they are provided while explicit typing like 'String', 'int', 'double', 'bool' needs to be explicitly assigned with the respective values.

    - Tried out different aspects of nullable and non-nullable concept with the underwhelming differences between final(usually for runtime constant) and const(compile time constant) modifiers.

    - Got to know about different scopes like global scope, local scope and instance scope in the dart programming language depending on which code block they are wrapped in "{}".

    - Some of the best and optimized tips and guidances like, if the const variable is at the class level, mark it static const. Although a final object cannot be modified, its fields can be changed. In comparison, a const object and its fields cannot be changed: they're immutable.
